These were among the first considerationem publishing this
edition of Virgil. It was believed, also, thata more correct
text dran anyin common use might be put into the hands ol
learners, by publishing iu a pular form that which is the result
ofthe combined labours of eyne, Heinsius, Burmann, Wakefield,
end others. Such is the text now offered to the youthful student
of thil. Itis substantially Heyne’s, which is undoubted-
ly the most perfect text extant, but with such slight varia-
tions as a careful collation ol the abovemenn'oned authorities
seemed to recommend. lt is printed from Didot’s stereotype
edition. Audit is confidendy believed, should any instructers
examine the work, who have hitherto been confined to the use
os the Delphin text, that they will in this find many perplex-
ities and stumblingblocks removed.

ln preparing the Notes, free use hasbeen made os all the
materiale within the editor's reach. ln all cases, where it could
consistently be done, the authority has been given, except where
the notes os Mr. Valpy’s edition have been adopted. These,
as his own remarks are frequently blended with other author·
ities, have not been particularly designated. The notes of
the learned l. H. Voss were first 'made English for that edi·
tion, to which notes this is 'likewise indebted. The notes are
3111111111511111ῗ111111111111113111 ll
student’s reach. ln the vast variety of materiale resented, it
has been found difficult to be sufficiendy concise. lfor it is easy
to say much upon Virgil, but difficolt to say a little to the point.
Boys will not voluntarily read long notes, even in their vemacular

tongue; much lessina foreign langu ge. But, when embarrass—

ed, they will seelr relies from notes, i they are short.

As no boy should be pennitted to read Virgil without being
able to acan every verse before he reads it, it was thought advis-
able to subjoin alist os the most difficolt verses with the method
os scanning each, as this will save the reacher from frequent
interruptione while the student is reparing for recitation. The
authority of Dr. Carey hasbeen followed in the Metrical Key.
A few questions have also been added, at the suggestion of some
of our most respectable instructers, which may expedite the la·
bour of the tencher in ascertainmg whether the pupil has con·
suited his notes and his Classical Dictionary, and lead to e
more connected and definite view os the subject than tlre pupd
would otherwise obtain.
