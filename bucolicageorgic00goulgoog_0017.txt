lr any one cause has operated more tlran every other to
present young men from acquiring afree and easy manner of
reading the Latin poets, it unquesthurably is the habit of using aa
arder ‹iscomtmetton or an interpretation. 'Ihe use of these
pemicious helps not only preventa those who rely on them from
eret acquiring the power of reading with ease and pleasure

without diem, but rt rs utterly subversive of one of the pnnoipal
objeets of studying the lan age, that mental discipline which la
acqttiredb the practice o entical and exact analysis. ¹'I'his
aharary' enee, the useofan order or ofan interpretation
effetarnlly oounteracts.

'l'be student will hardly take the pains of disemangliug an
intricate sentence when tbe worlr is done to his hand, nor will
tbe testof grammatica] construction or of ¹prosody be applied,
when a glauce at the interpretation will remove all doubts. The
babitof thus referrin to the judgment of others soon becomes
settled 3 while that ofenalysing is never formed, nor the discipline
of mind acquired, which it is strited to effect. Beeides this,
tlte habit of using these unnecessary aids prevents that feeling
of sslf-reliance which successful efforts alone can secure. ·

Το this cause we must attribute the fact, that so few aurong
our educated men read the Latin poets with ease or pleasure.
But if the habit of reading independently of foreign assistance be
once formed, the want ol such assistance is not felt. lt is found
b* experience that boys, who have been taught in this wa , read
llorace and Juvenal as readily as they do Cicero and acitus3
and even with more confidence 3 since in poetry they are fumish-
ed by prosody withan unerring test for resolving many doubts,
while u1 prose they have no such aid.

These are not new tiews. Beoks fumished with these aux·
iliaries are going out of use in the best schools iu foreign coun-
uies. 'I'ltiny years ago the learned aud practical Vicesimus
