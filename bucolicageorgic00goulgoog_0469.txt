sented holding a young cypress trec placlred up by the rocta. M.

21. Deaeque omine: after the special invocation ol'certaln divinities,
the poet proceeds, in conformity to the established ritual ol' the priests,
to invoke generally every divinity, supposed to rohsan interest in larm-
ing. 01 tbese several, each 11 whom presided over some one peculiar
operation in husbandry, are enumerated by Servius.

22. Non ullo.- ‘and you who take care os the new lruits which are

this adverb given by Servius, and adopted by the Delphin, is precipue ,·
but in this passage, and in verses 94 111187,αάοό seems to mean,
‘also, besides’ To be construed iu this order: 'lbqae oded, Ceasar,
praem ert incertam pac 11111111 deamat siat ltnbitura anos: velisne iaal-
sere urbis caramque habere terrunan, et 11111111 orbis accipiat te, lac.

33. Erigorvea . . . ‚sequentem Virga, in ihs zodlac, is Erigone. The
Chaldean astronomers madebat eleven signs. The projecting clavvs
ol' the Scorpion held the balance. 0v.ntet.ti.195·a; these, retracted,
the poet proposes shall afford space sor the new sign. Serv. By ardena,
and justd plur porte, the poet represents the eageruess and impatience
with which the Scorpion, ipae, ⁶ ol' bis own accord, has drawn back his
clavas, iu order to give roem, and more than sufficient roem, to the
new luminary.’ ·

48. aa puer . ...1111111 tbis passage is generally interpreted to mean
soar ploughings ; two given in the winter orearly spring, aad tuo during

cold; or, nsit is technically called, had troo cleany‘ullows. 11 some rare
instances, where the preceding husbandry bas been foul, this practice
may now be necessary, and every productiva crop may certainly be
expected.
