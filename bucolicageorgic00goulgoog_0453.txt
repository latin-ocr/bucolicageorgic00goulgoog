'l'wo sbepberds, alter mutual compliments, malre choice ot the
hle os Daphnis as ibe subject os their song: bis death is lamented
by Mopsus3 bis apotheosis celebrated by Menalcas. What person
Virgil had in view under the name ol' Daphnis, bas been tbe subject
ol much debete. Abrotber ol his own, who died in early lile. bas
been suggested by some interpretare: by others, the Sicilian shepberd,
ttt¹ the same natue, whose death is lamented by Theocritus, ldyl. i:
Quintilius Varus, or Julius Caesar, hythe greater number. Consider-
eble difficulty attende each hypothesis: it is possible tlrat a mere
imitation of Theocritus was intended, and not the expression os grief
lor any particular individual. ll Virgil ever means te represent him-
self, it is bere under the name of Menalcas: under that oi lllopsus,
was meant, according te Servius, AEmilius blacer‚a poet os Verona,
aud a friend os Virgil.

tl. Codri : the names ol Phyllis, Alcon, and Codrus, probably do
not refer to any real persons, bat were taken by tbe poet arbitrarily,
ιε occurring in supposed pastoral poetry which Menalcas retains in
his memory, as formerly recited by Mopsus. Voss.

23. Mater: as Julius Caesar l'ell at the age ns fifty-six, and ao mother
surrived him, it' does not seem prohable that he was the subject os
