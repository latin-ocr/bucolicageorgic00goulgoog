Llss OF VIRGIL. 425

lnquiries were made for tho author by order of Augustum hut as
Virgil was too diffident to discover himself, the verses were claimed
hy Bathyllus, a very ordinary poet of the time, who received a
splendid reward frum Augustus. 'Phia was more than virgil
would allow. lle accordingly wrote the distich again, and placed
under it the following:

ilos ego versiculos-

sud thel beginnipg ol another verse in these words, four timm
repeate ε ¹

Sic vos non vobis-

Bathyllus was requested to complete the verses, hut was unable
todo it. virgil then wrote them out thus r

llos ego versiculoslfeci, tulit alter honoret.
{a v: s: sustuleram..
333 33: lt: llll: stillantis.
rlnd therehy proved himself the author of the distich, to the no
small annoyance of Bathyllus, who afterwards became the subject
of much ridicule. ’
lis Virgil was one of the most benevolent and virtuous men of
the age, so he lived heloved, and died universally lamented. Just
before his death, he is said to have written for himself this very

modest and expressive epitaph:

”illulwllulllilh'l‘35:3⁰²”¹¹⁰⁰

Notwithstanding the pre-eminent natural endowments of virgil,
he unquestionably owed much to circumstances, and the age in
which he lived. He flourished in the hrightest era of Roman lit-
erature. Several distinguished scholare and men of genius had
immediately preceded him, and he was cotemporary with Nepos,
Sallust, Livy, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Horace, end l'haedrus.
With several of these he lived in hahita of personel intimacy and

friendshi .

The rgfinement and moral purity of his writings, no less than
the elegance and exquisite polish of his style, render the works
of virgil, above all others of the age, suitahle for the study and
contemplation uf youth.
