AENEID. BOOK lll.

AEnnns, having in the preceding book recounted the horrore 11 1111
capture of Troy, and the mannor 11 his own escape and 1111111 his
companions, proceeds to give Dido an account 11 what took place after·
warde, till the time when his 11111 was driven upon her coast.

This book is written on the model of the Odyssny. Tho events in
it occupy a space of nearly seven yearsr whereas those of no other
bools, except the fourth, which is taken up with an account of the sum-
mer AEncas spent at Carthage, extend beyond a few days. It contains,
therefore, a greater variety of incident than any other book3 and affords
the poet an opportunity of displaying his geo raphical, historical, and ·
mythological information3 aud ofexhibiting his skill in drawing pic·
tures of civil life. The exordium is highly wrought.
