Ama the battle of Philippi, which decided the fate of the repub·
licen party of Rome, and placed the empire in the power of the
Triumviri, Marlt Antony, Lepidus, and Caesar Octavianus, afterwards
Augustum these three agreed to confiscate, for the benefit of their
troops, all the lauded estates of eighteen Roman colonias. Early in
the arath year of Rome, this oppressiva plen was put in execution.
Among these devoted colonias was Cremona ς the inhabitants of which
were charged with the crime of adherente to the party of Brutus and
Cassius. This territory was found insufficient for the rapacity of the
soldiery to whom it was assigned, and that of Mantua was added, though
no such delinquency was imputed to its inhabitants.

Among the persons thus driven from their possessione, as has been
stated in his life, was Virgil3 who, having hed his property restored by
Angustus, is ltere represented, under the name of Tityrus, in quiet p'os·
session of it. llleliboeus represents another Mantuan, who, after his
expulsion, is, driving his little decla before him, and approaching the
spot where Tityrus is reclining. He commences the dialogus by ex·
pressing his astonishment that Tityrus is thus at his ease, exempt from
the general calamity.

It does not appear, however, that this neme, or any of those that ara
usually prefixed as titles to the Eclogues, were so prefixed hy Virgil
himself.
