receiving the share, divides into two parts, 0100001 10 aa acute angle.

The most obvious interpretation 01 1111ρὶ111...110110, would be that ¹

this was a double-furrowed plough, or worked with two shares; but
considering the weight 01 110 1001 described, aad 110 1001000011 re-
sistance, if such had been 110 construction, this solution 01 110 difficulty
does not seem probable, and indeed has never been proposed. Cuy'au
[dorsi 1] urnamque eminet larsa 10 the explanation of Servius: hut which
throws 00 light. Martyu speaks 01 two legs, 000 01 which was fast-
eued 10110 bottom of the tall, 110 01101 nailed to the haam: this is
not clearly explained, but is adopted by Heyne apparently without
comprehending it: iu 0000000 could 11110 10 termed duplae dorsum. As
the ltalian plough-share appears 10 10 01010 10 0 wedge form, aad
therefore 10 110 0101010001 10 010010 greater friction 1100 0010, 11 11111
require to be more strongly set. The duplex 1101111111 may therefore
mean a doudle buck, 01 ground, 10 which the share is fixed, not standing
diagonally, aa seems 10 10 lllartyn's meaning, nor perpendicularly,
hut, at some few laches distance one immediately ahove the other,
horizoatnlly. Though this seems the most simple, indeed 1110101011-
plication of the 10101 10 110 text, it is by 00 means stated with confi· ’
