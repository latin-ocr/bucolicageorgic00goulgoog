ECLOGUE 11. ’ 433

tt. Aracyntho: Αιοροῑοο and his brother hetus were sostered by
thepherds living οο ιοο mountain Cithaeron. which is on the irontier oi
Attica and lloeotia. Pansae. i. 38. Aracynthus mttst have been aturvu
iu the satne neighbourhood, and is indeed noticed hy natne by Stepha-
nus Byzantinus. The epitbet Actes, Servius says, is received hom its
ricinity to tbe shore. lle adds that Athens itsell' was originally named
’.ιιτίο Amphion is called Dircaeus, either frum his stepuruther Dirce, ’
or hom a sountain ιο which ebe gave name. Serv.

26. Mare: however tranquil the surlaceoithe see, Servius denies that
it can eret ressect a human image so as thattbe likeness can be discerui-
ble. This passage is again a close imitation os Theocr. ldyl. vi. 34-7.

38. Tibi: iibeat tibi habiture nucum sordida rura.

29. Figere areos: as this term is applied also to sorlted stelias, sixed·
lor various purposes in the ground, Caes. B. G. vii. 72, it has beenan
understood in this passage: but the more direct interpretation is pres·
erable: caeos venari etjacalori. Serv.

30. Viridi hibisco: ‘with a green switch :’ this is the most oh·
,riuus meaning. Sprengel‚ ii. 3. calls hibiscus the althca' officinalis, a
species os mallow. The epithet viridis, and the authority of Servius,
lead some to suppose this to be a plaut οο which the kids browse'd,
though it seems as little iit sor this purpose as ior that ιο which it is*
applied, Ecl. x. 71. Τοο Delphin considers compellere hibisco to mean,
ad bibisctmt (sc. a lacte depulsos), as, it clamor coelo, AEu. v. 451. V iri-
dt‘qtteftnnem solarer hibisco. Calpurn. Ecl. iv. 32.

34. Poeniteet: see Ecl. x· 16.-Trieisse labellum: tbeso pipes, when
blowing, were moved on the lips.

36. cicutis: ‘hemloclt’ seems ill adopted to this purpose ς but this
lertn was also applied to the space between two knots in areed. Serv.
The elegance with which this passage is imitated by hope, ll. Pastoral,
³9. seqq. is praised by Heyne. ’

38. Secundum: ‘second owner!

40. Nec tart . · ..repertis i. e. strepenti in valle non rute. .

41. capreoli: the kids, to secure which had been attended with
danger, and which were then suckled by ewes, had apparently been
caught wild. Ovid,hlet. xiii. 834. seqq. imitatas several passages in·
this Eclogue. The hids be converte into two hear-whelps: Villosoe
catulos in summis montibus urso inveni.

44. Etsaciet: ‘aod she will obtain thero.’-Sordent: ‘are despised.’
coicum proe campo et Tiberino flumine sordeat? llor. Epist. l. ,

⁴6. Nympha: Nymphs presiding orer streame were named Neiads,
horn sirii: when dwelling in the sea, Nereids, hom Nereus, their fathers
in mountains, Oreuds, hermoni: in woeds, Dryads, irem tres: attached
to single trees, Hamadryads‚ srorn iliu and 'iriae presiding over groves,
h'upoeoe, from m'xi: orer meadows, Lemniades, from arnadi: over lakes,
unuani, from ates. D.—Calothis: ‘iu baskets' widening from the
bottom ιο the top. Plin. xxi. 5. describes a lily, effigie calathi, resupinis
